# adsorption
A python package with the purpose of assessing the most reliable isotherm models (i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Toth, Sips, DR), kinetic models (i.e., PFO, PSO, Weber-Morris, Avrami, Bangham, Elovich) and Arrhenius parameters (i.e., Ea, A), adsorption dynamic models (i.e., Thomas, Yoon-Nelson, Adams-Bohart), adsorption enthalpy and entropy as well as isosteric heat of adsorption.
